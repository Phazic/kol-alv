// This file lists all text augmentations to parsed log outputs.
// You can make manual changes/additions to this file if you want to.
// Note that the key names are case sensitive.
// If a key name is not used it will be seen as an empty string, so
// if you do not want to use a particular key, just delete it or
// comment it out from the list.
// In case you want to include a line change in a value, use N_L to
// mark the position.
// Changes to this file will be loaded the next time the Log Visualizer is started.

// Empty lines are ignored
// This is a comment :)
// Format for this file -> key name | value
// Nothing more :D
