Both the JCommon and JFreeChart libraries are bundled with the Ascension Log Visualizer jar file
you can download on this website, but both are relatively easy to exchange with newer and/or
otherwise modified versions. All you need to do is open the Ascension Log Visualizer jar file with
an archive managing tool such as WinRAR, 7-Zip or File Roller (this is possible because a jar file
is actually a simply renamed zip archive) and replace both libraries with their modified counterparts
(the file names are important, make sure they are the same as the ones used in the MANIFEST file).
Please note that the libraries that replace the ones inside the Ascension Log Visualizer jar file
have to be interface-compatible, otherwise the Ascension Log Visualizer will not be able to run.
Making sure that this is the case is however a task for the person who tries to use the modified
versions of these libraries.

The Ascension Log Visualizer does not use modified versions of the JCommon and JFreeChart libraries,
thus you are able to download their sources directly from their project download page.

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15494

The currently used versions are JCommon 1.0.16 and JFreeChart 1.0.13. (if you have problems with
accessing that site or finding the correct versions, contact one of the developers of the Ascension
Log Visualizer so they can send you the sources directly)
