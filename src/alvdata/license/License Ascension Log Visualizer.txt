This tool is a means to parse and/or visualize ascension logs
so as to make it easier to analyze them.


This program would not have been possible without the logging
capabilities of KolMafia. Also, the basic idea for visualizing
ascension logs and many other basic features of this program
came from KujjieKujjieKoo as did some ascension logs to help
test various functionalities and iron out the code in the early
stages of this program.

Another thanks goes out to Friederike for providing ascension
logs when they were most needed in the very early stages of this
program.

The idea for parsing KolMafia logs into a more human-readable
form, the format of these parsed logs and some of the less obvious
features (such as gCLI notes parsing) have been borrowed from
the AFH MafiaLog Parser created by VladimirPootin and
QuantumNightmare. A very big thank you should be ushered to
them by anyone using this program, because without them and their
parser this program probably would not have been written.

And last, but not least, a thanks has to be thrown out to
everyone that gave feedback in the AFH or HCO forum threads for
this tool. It is all *very* appreciated. =)

Please note that if you want to send feedback to the developers
